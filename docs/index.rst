üåà ``tractor.Beam()``
---------------------

The ``Beam`` class serves as the core engine of a highly configurable,
modular library designed for parallel processing and automation of tasks
such as web scraping, data downloading, processing, and storage. This
class leverages various components and lower-level functions to
orchestrate complex workflows. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at its roles and
interactions with other components:

‚öôÔ∏è Initialization and Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon initialization, the ``Beam`` class loads and verifies the
configuration using the ``Config`` class. It checks if the
configuration adheres to the expected structure and format,
indicating the system‚Äôs readiness to execute tasks as defined by
the user.

Job Processing and Workflow Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Job Processing**: The ``process_job`` and ``_runner`` methods are
   central to executing tasks defined in the configuration. These
   methods handle the execution flow of each job, including data
   downloading (``Abduct`` class), data recording (``Visits`` class),
   and data processing (``Focus`` class). This showcases the class‚Äôs
   ability to manage diverse tasks sequentially, ensuring each step is
   completed before moving to the next.
-  **Parallel and Delayed Execution**: The ``go`` method orchestrates
   the execution of all jobs, allowing for parallel processing to
   optimize resource utilization. It uses Python‚Äôs ``multiprocessing``
   to distribute tasks across available CPU cores, enhancing efficiency,
   especially for CPU-bound tasks. Additionally, it supports delayed
   execution for specific jobs, enabling time-controlled or periodic
   task execution.
-  **Resource Management**: By leveraging the ``Pool`` class from
   ``multiprocessing`` for parallel execution, the ``Beam`` class
   efficiently manages system resources. It calculates the optimal
   number of processes based on the number of available CPU cores and
   the number of jobs, ensuring a balance between performance and
   resource usage.

üìù ``utils.Config()``
---------------------

The ``Config`` class is responsible for loading, parsing, saving, and
manipulating configuration data. It can load configuration from a file
or a dictionary, parse the configuration data into a structured format,
save the configuration to a file, unbox the configuration by creating a
project directory, create a new project directory with a configuration
file, and destroy a project directory.

Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

   # Load configuration from a file
   config = Config('config.json')
   config.load_conf('config.json')

   # Load configuration from a dictionary
   config_dict = {
       "role": "watcher",
       "settings": {
           "name": "my_project",
           "proj_dir": "/path/to/project",
           "jobs": [
               {
                   "url": "https://example.com",
                   "types": ["type1", "type2"],
                   "beacon": "beacon1",
                   "delay": 1.5,
                   "custom": {
                       "func": "my_function",
                       "headers": {"header1": "value1"},
                       "types": ["type3", "type4"]
                   }
               }
           ]
       }
   }
   config.load_conf(config_dict)

   # Save the configuration to a file
   config.save()

   # Unbox the configuration by creating a project directory
   config.unbox()

   # Create a new project directory with a configuration file
   config.create()

   # Destroy a project directory
   config.destroy(confirm="my_project")

üì° ``abduct.beacons.*``
----------------------

‚Äúbeacons‚Äù play a crucial role in a highly customizable and modular
system designed for web scraping, downloading, and processing data from
various sources. These beacons, represented by modules like the Stream
class, are key to achieving flexibility and modularity in the system.
The structure and functionality of the ‚Äúbeacons‚Äù can be documented as
follows:

Role of Beacons
'''''''''''''''

Modularity:
^^^^^^^^^^^

Beacons act as interchangeable modules within the system. Each beacon
corresponds to a specific source or type of data (e.g., financial
filings, news articles) and encapsulates the logic necessary for
fetching, parsing, and processing data from that source. This modularity
allows users to easily extend the system‚Äôs capabilities by adding new
beacons for different sources without altering the core functionality.

Customizability:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Beacons are designed to be customizable, allowing
users to specify parameters and behaviors specific to the data source
they target. This is evident in the Stream class, where the fetch method
can be tailored to parse and retrieve data according to the unique
structure of each source.


The Helpers class within a beacon further aids in bespoke
processing and manipulating the fetched data

Uniform Interface:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Despite their differences in implementation, all beacons share a common
interface, exemplified by the mandatory inclusion of a Stream class with
consistent functions. This uniformity ensures that the main system can
interact with any beacon in a predictable manner, facilitating ease of
integration and use.

Enhanced Functionality through Helpers:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the presence of a Stream class is mandatory for basic operations, the
inclusion of a Helpers class within a beacon provides additional utility
functions that are specific to the data or operations related to that
beacon. This structure offers an extended layer of customization,
enabling complex data manipulation and processing tasks that are
tailored to the beacon‚Äôs specific use case. 

Integration with the Main System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Beacons are seamlessly integrated into the main system, as
demonstrated by the use of importlib for dynamic module loading and the
structured approach to passing configurations and job details to
beacons. This integration allows the system to leverage the unique
capabilities of each beacon while maintaining a cohesive workflow.

Conclusion
''''''''''

The ‚Äúbeacons‚Äù in this system embody the principles of modularity,
customizability, and extensibility, serving as specialized modules that
can be dynamically integrated to add or modify the system‚Äôs data
processing capabilities. By adhering to a consistent interface while
allowing for beacon-specific customizations, the system achieves a
balance between uniformity and flexibility, enabling it to cater to a
wide range of data sources and processing requirements. This
architecture not only enhances the system‚Äôs utility and adaptability but
also facilitates ease of maintenance and expansion, making it a robust
solution for customizable and modular data processing tasks.

üîç ``laser.Focus()``
--------------------

The ``Focus`` class is responsible for processing files by reading their
contents, detecting the encoding, and performing specific actions based
on the file type. It uses the ``Strip`` class to sanitize and extract
text content from XML or HTML documents. The processed data is then
written to a file using the ``writeme`` function.

.. _example-usage-3:

Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

   # Initialize a Focus object with a configuration and job
   focus = Focus(conf=conf, job=job)

   # Process a list of files
   data = [{'path': 'file1.xml'}, {'path': 'file2.html'}]
   result = focus.process(data)

   # Destroy a file
   focus.destroy(confirm='file1.xml')
